<p class="h2">About Me</p>
<p class="paragraph">Karen J Hernandez is a NYC based freelance photographer who specializes in event and portrait photography.<br>

Photography runs in her blood as her paternal grandfather collected film cameras in his Country. One day, <br> her father passed on the tradition of photography to her at a young age and ever since that day, she hasn't <br>been able to put a camera down. 

Photography has always been the pathway to document stories of those <br>she encountered and has stuck with that approach with event photography. Whether it be a wedding,<br> children's events, live music, sometimes portraits for actors or musicians, the end result is to tell a story. <br>
